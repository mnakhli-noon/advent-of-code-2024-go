# Advent of Code 2024 - Go Learning Journey 🎄🧊

## About This Repository

Welcome to my Advent of Code adventure! This repository is a personal learning project where I'm diving into the Go programming language by solving the Advent of Code challenges.

### My Learning Approach 🚀

- **Day-by-Day Learning**: I'll be solving each puzzle first in my own way
- **Collaborative Improvement**: After my initial solution, I'll share my code with Claude.ai
- **Go Language Mastery**: Seeking guidance to understand the "Go way" of solving problems

## Learning Goals

- [ ] Understand Go's syntax and idioms
- [ ] Learn best practices in Go programming
- [ ] Improve problem-solving skills
- [ ] Complete as many Advent of Code challenges as possible

## How This Works

1. I solve the puzzle using my current knowledge
2. I consult Claude.ai for:
   - Code review
   - Idiomatic Go improvements
   - Learning opportunities
